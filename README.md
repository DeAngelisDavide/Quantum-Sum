# Quantum Adder
This project implements a generalized quantum adder that sums two non-negative integers using quantum circuits in Qiskit. 

## Overview

The quantum adder uses quantum gates to perform the addition operation. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the principles of quantum computing and how quantum circuits can be constructed for basic arithmetic operations. In real applications Quantum algorithms that leverage superposition and other quantum properties are typically used for more efficient computations.

## Usage

1. **Install Qiskit**: Ensure you have Qiskit, Qiskit-Aer and Qiskit-IBM-Runtime installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip:

   ```
   pip install qiskit qiskit-aer qiskit-ibm-runtime
